**Song Scraper.py**

  This is how the data set is generated. I used the web scraper built [here](https://github.com/sharpie-007/dataAndMusic/blob/master/49%20Years%20of%20Music%20-%20Collection%20and%20Analysis.ipynb)
 which was slightly broken, so it needed minor fixes to work. This outputs a csv and json file containing the song data of the top 100 songs from the past 60 years. It takes about 6 hours to run, but could be done way quicker with parallel processing.

**Analysis.py**


This is our main program. The code is cluttered and was mainly used to generate graphs and had variables changed to generate new ones, which were used for our presentation.
